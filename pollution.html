<legend>About Pollution</legend>
<p class="para1">Pollution, also called environmental pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form.
The major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Modern society is also concerned about specific types of pollutants, such as noise pollution, light pollution, and plastic pollution.
Pollution of all kinds can have negative effects on the environment and wildlife and often impacts human health and well-being.</p>

<h2> History</h2>
<p>Air pollution has always accompanied civilizations.Pollution started from prehistoric times, when man created the first fires. According to a 1983 article in the journal Science, "soot" found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires."[4] Metal forging appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. Core samples of glaciers in Greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with Greek, Roman, and Chinese metal production.</p>
<h2 > Types of Pollution</h2>
<p>As stated before, there are different types of pollution, which are either caused by natural events (like forest fires) or by man-made activities (like cars, factories, nuclear wastes, etc.) These are further classified into the following types of pollution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Air Pollution</li>
<li>Water Pollution</li>
<li>Soil Pollution</li>
<li>Noise Pollution</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides these 4 types of pollution, other types exist such as light pollution, thermal pollution and radioactive pollution. The latter is much rarer than other types, but it is the deadliest</p>

The release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere.Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5.

<h3> Water Pollution </h3>

Water pollution is said to occur when toxic pollutants and particulate matter are introduced into water bodies such as lakes, rivers and seas.
These contaminants are generally introduced by human activities like improper sewage treatment and oil spills. However, even natural processes such as eutrophication can cause water pollution.
Water Pollution: Water, a renewable resource, is a vital compound for life on Earth. It is the only inorganic liquid that occurs on the Earth naturally. Covering three-fourth of parts of the Earth, Water contains about 97.5% of the Earth in saline nature, and the rest 2.5% is freshwater.

<h3> Soil Pollution </h3>

Soil pollution, also called soil contamination, refers to the degradation of land due to the presence of chemicals or other man-made substances in the soil. The xenobiotic substances alter the natural composition of soil and affect it negatively. These can drastically impact life directly or indirectly. For instance, any toxic chemicals present in the soil will get absorbed by the plants. Since plants are producers in an environment, it gets passed up through the food chain. Compared to the other types of pollution, the effects of soil pollution are a little more obscured, but their implications are very noticeable.
Some of the common causes of soil pollution are:
<ul>
<li>Improper industrial waste disposal</li>
<li>Oil Spills</li>
<li>Acid rain which is caused by air pollution</li>
<li>Mining activities</li>
<li>Intensive farming and agrochemicals (like fertilisers and pesticides)</li>
<li>Industrial accidents</li>
</ul>

<h3> Noise Pollution </h3>

<p>Noise pollution refers to the excessive amount of noise in the surrounding that disrupts the natural balance. Usually, it is man-made, though certain natural calamities like volcanoes can contribute to noise pollution.
In general, any sound which is over 85 decibels is considered to be detrimental. Also, the duration an individual is exposed plays an impact on their health. For perspective, a normal conversation is around 60 decibels, and a jet taking off is around 15o decibels. Consequently, noise pollution is more obvious than the other types of pollution.
Noise pollution has several contributors, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry-oriented noises such as heavy machines, mills, factories, etc.</li>
<li>Transportation noises from vehicles, aeroplanes, etc.</li>
<li>Construction noises</li>
<li>Noise from social events (loudspeakers, firecrackers, etc.)</li>
<li>Household noises (such as mixers, TV, washing machines, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Noise pollution has now become very common due to dense urbanisation and industrialisation. Noise pollution can bring about adverse effects such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing loss</li>
<li>Tinnitus</li>
<li>Sleeping disorders</li>
<li>Hypertension (high BP)</li>
<li>Communication problems</li>
</ul>
